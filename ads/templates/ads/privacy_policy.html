  <strong>E-Commerce and Our Secure Server</strong><br /><br />

  We understand that storing data in a secure manner is important.&nbsp; We store personal information using industry standard, reasonable and 

technically feasible, physical, technical and administrative safeguards against foreseeable risks, such as unauthorized access.&nbsp; All 

commerce transactions that take place on the Site are processed through our secure server in order to make every reasonable effort to insure that 

your personal information is protected. <br /><br />
  Please be aware that the Site and data storage are run on software, hardware and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, 

require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security beyond the Site&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee the security of the 

information on and sent from the Site.&nbsp; <br /><br />
  On our Site, you may have the opportunity to follow a link to other sites that may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the 

privacy practices of those sites or the content provided thereon.&nbsp; We disclaim any responsibility for transactions conducted on those sites 

and cannot vouch for the security of the information submitted in those transactions. <br /><br />

  <strong>Policy Changes and Acceptance</strong><br /><br />

  The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security 

best practices evolve.&nbsp; We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy so that it will be easier for you to 

know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy 

practices.&nbsp; Each time you access, use or browse the Site, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy 

applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.&nbsp; <br /><br />
  Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after Last Revised 

date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.&nbsp; <br /><br />
